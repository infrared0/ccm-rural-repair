                        Esther Jang is a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Washington (UW) with primary research interests in connectivity, appropriate technology, and human-centered design for and with low-income populations in developing regions. She graduated from MIT in 2016 with a BSc in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and a MS in Networks and Communications. In the past four years, she has worked on the Village Base Station (VBTS) project with the University of the Philippines (UP) deploying community cellular networks (CCNs) in rural areas, and on wireless connectivity for rural schools in Tanzania. She has experience in user-centered and collaborative design through working in assistive technology. Through this project she hopes to combine her interests in network connectivity and technology education in resource-constrained settings.

                        Ronel has always been passionate about learning. In view of advancing his knowledge and skills through being at the heart of Research and Development, he joined WCEL's Affiliate Program in 2010 while he was still taking up his Bachelor of Science Degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering at the University of the Philippines-Diliman. Driven by the eagerness to learn, he then grabbed the opportunity to be part of the Engineering and Deployment Team of several WCEL Projects including CloudTop Program and Robust and Rapidly Deployable GSM Basestations and Backhaul for Emergency Response (ROGER) Project. Currently, he's involved in the Village Basestation (VBTS) Project funded by the Philippine-California Advanced Research Institutes (PCARI) Project of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) offering his years of acquired engineering and field deployment skills. Concurrently, he's working towards completing his Masters of Engineering in Electrical Engineering from the University of the Philippines-Diliman.

                    <p>
                        In her undergraduate years, Thessa had proven her competency in the field of Antenna Design when she was given the chance to design and implement a 2x2 Microstrip Patch Antenna. Her commendable work performance paved way to a number of opportunities including job offers in several promising WCEL Projects such as (1) CloudTop Program, (2) Robust and Rapidly Deployable GSM Basestations and Backhaul for Emergency Response (ROGER) and (3) The Village Basestation (VBTS) Project. With Antennas being crucial in most if not all WCEL Projects, Thessa is considered an asset to the laboratory.
